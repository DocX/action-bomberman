ARENA FILES
===========

All files located in data/arenas directory are treated as map
definition files. They are listed in pre-game menu. These files
have to be in right format (see ARENA FILE FORMAT).

ARENA FILE FORMAT
=================

Arena file is simple text file which consists of 3 sections.
First is dimension declaration, second is map tiles definition
and third is starting positions list. All sections is immediately
after each other without spaces.

First section is only one line with number of rows and columns
of map, in that order. For example (4 rows, 5 columns)

4 5

Second section contains "bitmap" of arena map. Each tile have
two letters and each tile is seperated with space and each map
row is on separated line.
First tile letter defines surface, second bonus on tile.
Surfaces:
  G .. ground
  W .. unexplosive wall
  B .. explosive bricks
  R .. randomly B or G
Bonuses:
  N .. none
  R .. random (from both good and bad and none)
  G .. random from good
  D .. random from bad
  
  B .. bomb (good)
  P .. power (good)
  S .. speed inc (good)
  K .. kick (add ability to kick bombs) (good)
  I .. shield (good)

  L .. temprary slowness (bad)
  H .. hyperactive (placing bombs all time) (bad)
  W .. wet (cannot place bombs) (bad)
  
For example (4x5 map with wall around and some bonuses)

WN WN WN WN WN
WN GB GN GS WN
WN GP GN GK WN
WN WN WN WN WN

Third section is list of starting positions in format
similar to first section. 2 numbers per line. This positions
are used for creating game. If there is less positions than
players, more players can be placed at one position. So
create at least 4 or 5 positions. Columns and rows are counted
from 0 (first column is 0, second 1,...)

For example (positions on tiles w/o bonuses from above):

1 2
2 2
